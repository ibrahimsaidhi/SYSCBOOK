# SYSCX

This is a project created for the Winter 2024 offering of SYSC 4504 - Fundamentals of Web Development at Carleton University. It is a mini social media application that allows users to register and customize profiles, as well as post status updates of what they're up to. The stack consists of MySQL, PHP, HTML, and CSS. 

### Running the application

Start by [downloading and installing XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html).

Once you have downloaded XAMPP, open a file explorer, or a terminal of your choosing, and go to `C:\xampp\htdocs`. This is where you want to clone the repository to. 

Once this is completed, open the XAMPP Control Panel.

Run both the Apache and MySQL servers.

On the control panel, run the admin for MySQL to access phpMyAdmin.

Once opened, copy and paste the SQL dump from `ibrahim_said_a03.sql` in the repository folder onto a new SQL editor. This will create the database for the application.

When all of this is set, open http://localhost/YourPathToRepository/register.php. This will allow for you to register a new user.
